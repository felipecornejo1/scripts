# Scripts

In this repository, I store some bash scripts that I use for various purposes.

### batterycheck.sh

This is a script that helps me get notified of my battery status in my i3 desktop. Since there is no built-in system that sends notifications related to battery level, the solution I've implemented is to run this script periodically so that I get notified when I'm running low on battery.

### git-branch-delete

Opens a fuzzy finder to delete a git branch.

### tmux-sessionizer

Opens a fuzzy finder to find a directory, and move to an existing tmux session inside that directory, or create a new one if it doesn't exist.
